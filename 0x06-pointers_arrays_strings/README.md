## Description
This is another project in the _Pointers, arrays and strings_ section in the ALX SE program
Most of it seems to replicating common string functions like `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strncat`, `to_upper` and so on.

## Notes
* In the`_strcmp` function, the difference between the ASCII values of the first mismatch is what is returned.
