## Decription
This is the third section of the _Pointers, Arrays and Strings_ section in the ALX SE program.

## Personal Notes
* I have started putting myself under the limitations of `_putchar`
* The terminal isn't supposed to be the first place of engagement if you don't have anything in mind
* I have finished my first month officially even though we started this since January.
