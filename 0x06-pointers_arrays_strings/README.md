## Description
This is another project in the _Pointers, arrays and strings_ section in the ALX SE program
Most of it seems to replicating common string functions like `strcpy`, `strcat`, `strncat`, `to_upper` and so on.

## Notes
* In the`_strcmp` function, the difference between the ASCII values of the first mismatch is what is returned.
* Once again, ALX is up to their shenanigans as the 6-cap\_string.c file only works with one hell of an `if` statement but fails when a `for` loop is used. I have however put my take on this (as I see no reason for it to fail) as 6-second\_take.c
