## Description
This is the continuation of the functions and nested loops module for the ALX SE program.

### Personal Notes
1. Honestly, ALX be tripping with some of their checks sometimes. A very good example is the `more_numbers()` method. There are multiple solutions with my own take written in `my_take.txt` but ALX just wants the `_putchar` functions called three times no matter what.
2. Remember, the way you **conditions** always matter, NEVER forget the _**the order of the conditions**_.
