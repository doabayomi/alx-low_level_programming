## Description
Variaidic functions are functions that can take multiple arguments. This is the projects related to variadic functions for the ALX SE program.

## Personal Notes
* ALX has started with this wierd trend of making very large and constrained question. Yesterday, there were three files in a singular question. :worried: It seems ALX is pushing the boundary of what can really be considered one question.
* In today's last project, I dare not try to use `if` because of how constrained it was. I ended up going around the question by using `switch...case`. I belief that it is almost impossible any other way. :weary:. I'm tired of this. :dissapointed:
